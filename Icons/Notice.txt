I am unaware of the license for Google's Chrome icon, however I made a replica of it for Chromatic as my application is made to download Chromium which has a similar icon to Google's Chrome icon. I do not sale Chromatic or the replica of Google's Chrome icon and only plan to give the replica away in the public domain as long as people understand that it may be a trademark of Google or copyrighted by Google and know that I do not provide any warranty what so ever for the replica. If you get in trouble for using it, do not come crying to me and do not say that I made it as I am not responsible for your actions.

Google, if you see this, I will remove the icon and ask my followers for ideas of newer icons for my application if requested. I couldn't think of anything that says what my application does other than a green (represents download in many places) replica of the Chrome/Chromium icon. I consider the use of the replica as fair use as I am not saying I'm Google or that I am Google Chrome/Chromium.
